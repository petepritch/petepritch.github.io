I've been actively working with NASA Langley on developing improvements to their Sequential Monte Carlo sampler - specifically for finite element modeling applications. My contributions primarly focus on theoretical and development iprovements to the foward kernels of the SMC mutation step by implementing gradient-accelerated features suited for high-performance computing clusters.
