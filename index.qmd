### Bio

I'm a second year [Masters of Applied Statistics](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats/masters_students/mastersprograms/applied-stats-masters-program.html) student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I obtained Bachelor's degrees in Economics and Applied Mathematics at the University of Tennessee, Chattanooga. And, before that, I spent four years living in Northern Spain, studying Marketing part-time at the University of Navarra (but mainly traveling and learning more about different cultures and myself). 

This past summer (and the one before that), I engineered advanced analytics platforms for internal usage at NASA's Glenn, Ames, and Langley Research Centers. I primarily used Python to build real-time data applications of operational and test data to provide comprehensive
visualizations, reveal patterns and drive more effective decision-making and business outcomes for a portfolio of wind tunnel facilities. Learn more about Aerosciences Evaluation and Test Capabilities Portfolio Office (AETC) [here!](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/armd/aetc/)

### Research

My research experience is rather broad. While an undergraduate student, I was fortunate enough to work under three different professors in various fields. First, I applied econometric methods to explore the dynamic connectedness of various currencies. Next, I assisted in the development of a mixed-integer linear model aimed to optimally locate emergency service vehicles. And lastly, I built deep neural network models to forecast the spread of infection diseases using trending Google Search key words. 

Currently, I am collaborating with NASA's Langley Research Center, developing methods to improve the performance of their open-source Sequential Monte Carlo Sampler library [(SMCPy)](https://github.com/nasa/SMCPy).

### Teaching

While completing my studies at The University of Michigan, I have had the pleasure of working as a Graduate Student Instructor for the Introduction to Statistics and Data Analysis undergraduate course (STATS 250). I've thoroughly enjoyed this aspect of my time as a graduate student, and would love to incorporate teaching into my work life from here on out. Some of the most interesting and influential people in my life are high school teachers, and I would love to one day fill those shoes.

### Personal Life

I've spent my formative years in Tennessee, but have called Mexico and Spain home at various points in my life. Since 2023, I have lived in Ann Arbor, MI, but anticipate that I will move to a large, coastal city once I graduate from UofM.

In my freetime, I enjoy watching films, cooking, going to the gym, reading, and watching my favorite sports teams (Tennessee Titans and Atlanta Braves). I developed an obsession with movies around my 19th birthday, and since then I've watched an almost-alarming number of films, documentaries and series.
